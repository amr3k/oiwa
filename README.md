> I was using a great [app](https://github.com/subhamtyagi/openinwa/) to open a whatsapp chat with a given number directly without saving that number in my contact list, but I felt it was overkill and uninstalled it, then searched telegram for a bot doint the same job but couldn't find so decided to make a new one.
